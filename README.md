Compute

Some pure python Math and Physics tools. These tools do not use numpy.  Some of the tests use numpy for validation of
the computation but the modules will remain pure python.  

The Vector class based on the math in the Appendix A of:
Bourg and Bywalec, Physics for Game Developers, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2013, 978-1449392512
There is on going work for the mass related classes.
